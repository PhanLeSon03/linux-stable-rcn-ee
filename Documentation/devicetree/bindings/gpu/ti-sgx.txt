TI SGX 3D Graphics Accelerator

Required properties:
 - compatible : value should take the following format:
	"ti,<soc>-<gpuversion>", "img,<gpuversion>"

   accepted values:
	(a) "ti,dra7-sgx544", "img,sgx544" for TI DRA7xx / AM57x
	(b) "ti,am4-sgx530", "img,sgx530" for TI AM43x
	(c) "ti,am3-sgx530", "img,sgx530" for TI AM33x
 - reg: base address and length of the SGX registers
 - interrupts : SGX interrupt number

Optional properties:
 - ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated with the SGX
 - clocks : from SoC clock binding
 - clock-names : names of clocks listed in clocks property in the same order
 - reg-names : names of registers listed in reg property in same order

Example:
	sgx@0x56000000 {
		compatible = "ti,dra7-sgx544", "img,sgx544";
		reg = <0x5600fe00 0x200>;
		reg-names = "gpu_wrapper";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		ti,hwmods = "gpu";
		clocks = <&l3_iclk_div>, <&gpu_core_gclk_mux>,
			 <&gpu_hyd_gclk_mux>;
		clock-names = "gpu_iclk", "gpu_fclk1", "gpu_fclk2";
	};
